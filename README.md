# SQL-Project-Layoffs-Analysis

## Project Overview:
The SQL project "Layoffs Analysis" involves examining a dataset that contains information about employee layoffs within a company or across multiple organizations. The primary objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the data using SQL queries and analysis techniques. Here is a detailed description of the project:

* Data Collection: The project begins with acquiring a dataset that includes relevant information about layoffs. This dataset may contain details such as employee ID, department, job title, date of layoff, reason for layoff, severance package details, and any other pertinent information related to the layoff events.

* Data Cleaning: Once the dataset is obtained, the next step is to clean the data. Data cleaning involves tasks such as handling missing values, correcting errors, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data consistency to prepare the dataset for analysis.

* Data Exploration: SQL queries will be utilized to explore the dataset and gain insights into the patterns and trends surrounding layoffs. This may involve analyzing the distribution of layoffs across different departments, identifying common reasons for layoffs, examining the impact of layoffs over time, and exploring correlations within the data.

* Trend Analysis: Through SQL queries, the project can delve into trend analysis to uncover patterns in layoffs data. This could involve identifying recurring patterns in layoffs over different time periods, seasonal variations in layoff occurrences, or department-specific trends that may offer valuable insights for decision-making.

## Introduction to the Dataset:
* Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas are hinting towards possible recession and tech firms have started laying employees off. This economic slowdown has made Meta recently fire 13% of its workforce, which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.

## Tools Used:
* SQL Server.
* SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS).

By engaging in the "Layoffs Analysis" project using SQL, individuals can gain valuable experience in data manipulation, analysis, and interpretation, while also contributing to informed decision-making processes related to employee layoffs and organizational dynamics.
